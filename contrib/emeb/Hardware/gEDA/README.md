#### EMEB_BMP2 assembled board

### What is it?

This is a revised layout for the original Black Magic Probe Mini from
Blacksphere which provides connections for several styles of JTAG connectors.
In addition to the 10-pin mini JTAG found on the original, it also has connections
compatible with the original 20-pin 0.1" pitch JTAG connector as well as the
ST-Link 6-pin 0.1" single row header.

Other than the addition of these connectors and a revised layout that's more
suited for DIY assembly, nothing has been changed. Original BMPM firmware is
100% compatible.
