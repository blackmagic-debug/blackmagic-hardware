This is a variant of the Blackmagic Mini that uses only 0603
parts and standard connectors for better availability and easier manual
soldering.

Additionally, another voltage regulator has been used that is
cheaper, pin-compatible and has better characteristics.

Schematic and PCB layout done using EAGLE.
